# Machine Learning course by Stanford University
# Programming Assignments

This repository contains my solutions for the programming assignments for the Machine Learning course taught by Andrew Ng (Stanford University) on Coursera. 

All the Jupyter Notebook templates and Python files were developed by [dibgerge](https://github.com/dibgerge/ml-coursera-python-assignments).
